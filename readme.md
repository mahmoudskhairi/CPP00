<p>Welcome to the 42 C++ Modules! This is a set of learning modules created to help you master the C++ programming language. Each module is designed to focus on specific concepts and gradually guide you through various fundamental and advanced topics in C++.</p>

<h2>Modules Overview</h2>
<p>The 42 C++ curriculum is divided into various modules that progressively introduce key concepts and coding challenges. The curriculum is structured to help students gain a comprehensive understanding of C++ and its intricacies.</p>

<h2>Modules List</h2>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the modules included in the 42 C++ program:</p>

<ol>
         <li><strong>Module 00: Basics of C++ and OOP</strong>
            <p>This module introduces the basics of C++ syntax and programming structures. You'll learn how to work with basic data types, control structures, and how to implement simple Object-Oriented Programming concepts like **classes**, **objects**, and **encapsulation**. This is your first step into understanding how C++ programs are structured and how to define and interact with simple classes and objects.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Module 01: Memory Management, Static and Dynamic Allocation, and File Handling</strong>
            <p>This module covers fundamental memory management concepts in C++, including static and dynamic memory allocation. You'll learn how to allocate memory for objects and manage object lifecycles to prevent memory leaks. Additionally, this module introduces **file handling** in C++, where youâ€™ll learn how to read from and write to files using file streams (`ifstream`, `ofstream`) and basic error handling techniques.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Module 02: Fixed Point and Floating Point Arithmetic</strong>
            <p>This module explores working with fixed point and floating point numbers. While it doesn't directly focus on OOP, it is critical for understanding how numerical values are represented and manipulated within C++ programs, which can be important when implementing more complex object behaviors in later modules.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Module 03: Inheritance</strong>
            <p>In this module, you'll delve deep into **inheritance**, a key concept of OOP. You'll learn how derived classes inherit behaviors and properties from base classes, enabling code reuse, and how to manage access control and constructor initialization in an OOP context.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Module 04: Polymorphism</strong>
            <p>This module covers **polymorphism**, one of the core OOP principles. You'll learn how to use **virtual functions**, enabling derived classes to override base class functions, and how to achieve dynamic binding to support polymorphic behavior.</p>
        </li>
</ol>

<h2>Learning Approach</h2>
<p>The 42 C++ program follows a hands-on approach, where students are encouraged to write code, solve challenges, and apply their knowledge. The exercises in each module are designed to test both understanding and problem-solving skills.</p>

<h2>Project-Based Learning</h2>
<p>At the end of each major module, you'll complete a project where you apply the concepts you've learned. These projects allow you to build real-world applications and get feedback from mentors and peers.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>While working on the modules, you have access to various resources:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Official 42 C++ Documentation</li>
    <li>Online C++ references and tutorials</li>
    <li>Interactive coding platforms (e.g., <a href="https://www.cplusplus.com/" target="_blank">cplusplus.com</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The 42 C++ modules are a challenging and rewarding learning journey. By completing the modules, you will gain a deep understanding of C++ and the skills needed to build professional applications.</p>
